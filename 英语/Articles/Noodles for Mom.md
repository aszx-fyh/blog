My mom works hard. She takes care of me and my young sister. Every day when she gets home from work,she supper for us.
One day,I decided to help my mom. She's always taking care of us and feeding us,so I figured,"It's about time I do something for her too. I'm nine years old."
I decided to cook supper for her. I don't know a lot about cooking. But it does't look that difficult,right? Noodles are easy to cook. All you do is boil water in a pot,then add the noodles and continue boiling. This was how I saw my mom doing it many times.
I was really excited. "Today,When my mom comes home,supper will be cooked. We will sit down and eat some tasty noodles," I said to myself.
After school I ran home eagerly and started cooking. I boiled the water on the stove and added the noodles. I was very careful. I cooked the noodles a long time.
It can't hurt,right?
Just before Mom got home,I turned off the stove. The noodles were not like the kind my mom usually makes.
They were very mushy. They were more like a soup.
Mom was surprised when she came home. She put the noodles in bowls and sit with me and ate her noodles.
"Mmm!There are very good noodles," she said. "There are the best noodles in the world. You make a very good noodle soup,my son."
I knew that I had overcooked the noodles. They were terrible. But that's not the point. Mom knew that I was trying to help out. Later,she told me that she would give me a cooking lesson if I wanted.
