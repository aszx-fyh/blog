Moms are moms. And when you're growing up, you don't always know how much they do for you. They're just moms. But they do some pretty cool thing too. They do things that you remember all your life.
My mom was like that. When I was six years old, one of my front teeth was very ==loose(adj.松动的；零散的;不严谨的；不道德的 v.释放，发泄；松开，解开)==. When I touched it, I could ==wiggle（v.扭动，摆动 n.扭动，摆动；波浪形线）== it back and ==forth（adv.离去，外出；（带）来，（拿）出；自...以后，向前；产生，得出）==. I was scared. I didn't know what was going on. So I asked Mom to look at it.
Mom said that I was going to ==lose（v.遗失，丢失，失去）== all of my teeth. "In the next few years, all of your teeth will ==fall out(掉落)==."
	"My teeth are going to fall out?" I cried. "How will I ==chew（v.咀嚼，嚼碎；咬，啃 n.咀嚼；口香糖）== my food?"
Mom laughed. "Don't worry", she said. "Each of us gets two sets of teeth. Your baby teeth are not designed to ==last（adj.最后的；最近的，上一个的；仅存的；最无关紧要的；v.持续；持久；坚持，支撑下去n.the last pron.最近发生的事情；最后的人；adv.最近，上次；最后）== a long time. They are there just to make a place for your ==permanent（adj.永久的，永恒的；）== teeth to come in."
==Still（adv.还，依旧；仍然，还是；静止地，不动地adj.静止的，不动的；宁静的，寂静的；v.使静止，平静，安静；）==, I was ==worried(adj.担心的，发愁的 v.担心；使发愁)==. "It will hurt so much," I said, I ==imagined（v.想象，设想；料想，认为；误以为，胡乱猜想）== how it would feel to have a tooth fall out, and it scared me just a little.
Mom said that she could help me. She asked me to sit in a chair and close my eyes.
Mom reached into my mouth and ==took hold of（握住）== the loose tooth.
"Keep your eyes ==shut（adj.关闭的，关上的；v.关闭，合上；n.关闭）==," she said. "Think about something funny. I will just check this tooth."
Then, Mom said, "Open your eyes." Do you know what? She was holding the tooth in her hand.
I could not believe it. While she was talking, she pulled the tooth out and I did not feel a thing!
That's just the way it is with moms. They know what to do. And they have a way of doing it that makes it ==painless（adj.无痛的；不痛的；）==.
