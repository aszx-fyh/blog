Moms are moms. And when you're growing up, you don't always know how much they do for you. They're just moms. But they do some pretty cool things too. They do things that you remember all your life.
My mom was like that. When I was six years old, one of my front teeth was very ==loose(adj.松动的；零散的;不严谨的；不道德的 v.释放，发泄；松开，解开)==. When I touched it, I could ==wiggle（v.扭动，摆动 n.扭动，摆动；波浪形线）== it back and ==forth（adv.离去，外出；（带）来，（拿）出；自...以后，向前；产生，得出）==. I was scared. I didn't know what was going on. So I asked Mom to look at it.
Mom said that I was going to ==lose（v.遗失，丢失，失去）== all of my teeth. "In the next few years, all of your teeth will ==fall out(掉落)==."
	"My teeth are going to fall out?" I cried. "How will I ==chew（v.咀嚼，嚼碎；咬，啃 n.咀嚼；口香糖）== my food?"
Mom laughed. "Don't worry", she said. "Each of us gets two sets of teeth. Your baby teeth are not designed to ==last（adj.最后的；最近的，上一个的；仅存的；最无关紧要的；v.持续；持久；坚持，支撑下去n.the last pron.最近发生的事情；最后的人；adv.最近，上次；最后）== a long time. They are there just to make a place for your ==permanent（adj.永久的，永恒的；）== teeth to come in."
==Still（adv.还，依旧；仍然，还是；静止地，不动地adj.静止的，不动的；宁静的，寂静的；v.使静止，平静，安静；）==, I was ==worried(adj.担心的，发愁的 v.担心；使发愁)==. "It will hurt so much," I said, I ==imagined（v.想象，设想；料想，认为；误以为，胡乱猜想）== how it would feel to have a tooth fall out, and it scared me just a little.
Mom said that she could help me. She asked me to sit in a chair and close my eyes.
Mom reached into my mouth and ==took hold of（握住）== the loose tooth.
"Keep your eyes ==shut（adj.关闭的，关上的；v.关闭，合上；n.关闭）==," she said. "Think about something funny. I will just check this tooth."
Then, Mom said, "Open your eyes." Do you know what? She was holding the tooth in her hand.
I could not believe it. While she was talking, she pulled the tooth out and I did not feel a thing!
That's just the way it is with moms. They know what to do. And they have a way of doing it that makes it ==painless（adj.无痛的；不痛的；）==.


妈妈就是妈妈。
Moms are moms.
当你长大的时候，你并不总是知道她们为你做了多少。
When you're growing up, you don't always know how much they do for you.
她们只是妈妈。但她们也做了些很酷的事情。
They're just moms. But they do some pretty cool thing too.
她们做了一些你一辈子都会记住的事情。
They do things that you remember all your life.
我的妈妈就是这样。
My mom was like that.
我六岁的时候，我的一颗前门牙松动了。
When I was six years old, one of my front teeth was  loose.
当我碰它的时候，我可以前后摆动它。
When I touched it, I could wiggle it back and forth.
我很害怕。
I was scared(~~~afraid~~~).
我不知道发生了什么。
I didn't know what was going on.
I didn't know what happened.
所以我让妈妈看了看。  
So I asked Mom to look at it.
妈妈说我会掉光所有的牙齿。“在接下来的几年里，你所有的牙齿都会掉光。”  
Mom said that I was going to lose all of my teeth. "All of your teeth will fall out in the next few years."
“我的牙齿要掉光了吗？”我哭着说。“我怎么咀嚼食物呢？”  
"My teeth are going to fall out?" I cried. "How will I chew my food?"
妈妈笑了。“别担心，”她说。“我们每个人都有两套牙齿。你的乳牙不会持续很长时间。它们只是为你的恒牙腾出位置。”  
Mom laughed. "Don't worry", she said. "Each of us gets two sets of teeth. Your baby teeth are not designed to last a long time. They are there just to make a place for your permanent teeth to come in."
然而，我还是很担心。“会很痛的，”我说，我想象着牙齿掉出来的感觉，这让我有点害怕。
However, I was still worried. "It will hurt so much," I said. I imagined how it would feel to have a tooth fall out, and it scared me a little. 
妈妈说她可以帮助我。她让我坐在椅子上，闭上眼睛。  
Mom said that she could help me. She asked me to sit in a chair and close my eyes.
妈妈伸进我的嘴里，握住了那颗松动的牙齿。  
Mom reached into my mouth and took hold of the loose tooth.
“闭上眼睛，”她说。“想想有趣的事。我只是检查一下这颗牙齿。”  
"Keep your eyes shut," she said. "Think about something funny. I will just check this tooth."
然后，妈妈说：“睁开眼睛。”你知道吗？她手里拿着那颗牙齿。
Then, mom said "Open your eyes." Do you know what? She was holding the tooth in her hand.
我简直不敢相信。在她说话的时候，她拔出了那颗牙齿，我一点感觉都没有！
I could not believe it! While she was talking, she pulled the tooth out and I don't feel anything at all(I don't feel a thing).
