[Act your age 按照年龄行事 - Chinadaily.com.cn](https://language.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202402/06/WS65c1dc4ea3104efcbdae9f92.html)

Reader question:

Please explain "act his age", as  in this sentence(n.句子): The judge told him to act his age after avoiding jail(n.监狱,监禁;v.监禁) sentence(n.判决,判刑) for hitting his girlfriend.

My comments:

This guy is immature(adj.发育未全的;幼稚的,不成熟的;粗糙的). That's what the judge implies(v.暗示;意味着;必然包含) here. Let's say this guy is 45(forty five) years of age, not 15(fifteen). Hitting one's girlfriend at any age is not acceptable, to be sure. But the thing being implied here is immature part. If you are 15, young and immature, it's slightly(adv.稍微,轻微地;(指某人身材)纤弱地,瘦小的) more understandable.

To be clear, it's unaccpetable for people of any age to use violence(n.暴力,暴行;(言行的)狂暴,激烈) to make a point but at least you're more forgivable if you're young and don't know better. That's why the judge told this guy to, in  future, act in a way befitting(adj.适合的/v.适合) his age. In other words, act your age.

Act your age!

That's something we often hear parents say whenever we do something silly(adj.愚蠢的,傻的;嬉笑滑稽的;失去理智的;) and immature. By "act your age", what parents are saying is "you are too old for that kind of stuff(n.东西,物品;基本特征,特指;根本/v.塞进;填满)".
In other words, grow up. Parents want us to behave with maturity(n.(思想行为、作品等）成熟；发育成熟，长大成人；到期；（债券等）偿还期；（保险单、证券等）有固定到期日的票据)). They expect us to behave in a manner(n.态度,举止;礼貌;方式) appropriate(adj.合适的,相称的/v.拨出(款项);私占,挪用) to our age and not to the age of someone much younger.

See?

All right, and oh, conversely(adv.相反地,反过来说), if a young kid acts like an old man, he can also be admonished(vt.告诫;劝告) for not acting his age. Or on the other hand, a senior(adj.年龄大些的;高级的;高水平的;) citizen(n.市民,城镇居民;公民,国民) who has the easy gait(n.步法,步态/vt.训练步法) of an athlete(n.运动员;擅长运动的人) can be commended(v.赞扬;推荐;被接受,得到认可;把...委托给) for not acting his or her age.

It all depends. Age is relative, as they say.

Oh, well, for better or worse, here are media examples of people acting or not acting their age:

1. Christian Lopez had just finished high school when his debut album(n.唱片，专辑；相册，影集，集邮册) Onward made him a standout(n.杰出的人;adj.杰出的;出色的) in roots music circles. The album felt uncannily(adv.惊异的;神秘地;不寻常地;危险地) poised and wise-beyond its years-an indie-folk throwback of worldly, self-written songs and old-soul vocals with tracks like "Moring Rise" and "The Man I Was Before" presenting powerful ideas of what a mature relationship might look like. Lead single "Will I See You Again" also garnered more than a million Spotify streams on the strength of its infectious hooks an d simple-but-insightful lyrics(n.歌词;抒情诗;adj.抒情的,柔美的).
