Buzz.Buzz.Buzz! On warm summer nights,the air is filled with the familiar sound of mosquitoes looking for a meal.
These tiny insects are found everywhere,except in the coldest regions of the world. Most of us don't like them.
They can run a quiet evening. If there are enough of them,their biting can force us inside for protection.
The bite does't really hurt that much. Our skin swells where we are bitten. It gets itchy and can turn red,but in a few hours,the itching goes away.
Did you know that only female mosquitoes bite?
A female mosquito needs some protein in her diet to make eggs and have babies. She gets his protein from the blood of mammals. She is not too fussy which mammals she bites. Any mammals will do,including humans.
The female mosquito's mouth has a long sharp point used to puncture the skin. The female then draws up some blood as if she were drinking with a straw.
Mosquitoes have excellent smelling abilities and use their noses to find us. Humans are mammals,and that means we give off carbon dioxide when we breathe out.
When a female picks up this scent,she moves in for her meal.
Some of us are more attractive to the females than others. Scientists don't exactly know why. Some suggest that the colour of our clothing or our blood type make some if us easier targets.
We might hate these bothersome little bugs,but like all things in an eco-system,they have a purpose. Many animals,such as bats and birds,make mosquitoes a big part of their diet.
For sure,mosquitoes are not fun when all we want to do is sit outside and enjoy a queit summer evening. But there are things we can do to protect ourselves:wear a long-sleeved shirt or put on good insecticide can help keep these bugs away.
