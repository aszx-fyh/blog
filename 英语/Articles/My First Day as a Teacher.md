Ms.Wood, our Grade 3 teacher,is a really good teacher. She cares about her students. That's why she was named "Teacher of the Year" for our school district.
Today, Ms.Wood told us a funny story about her first day as a teacher. She said,"On my first day as a teacher, I was nervous. I was scared. I told myself I will never be able to do this!"
"The morning I was to begin teaching,I arrived really early. My hands were shaking. My throat was dry. My stomach was filled with butterflies. I looked at the clock. The students wolud arrive in five minutes. I felt a wave of panic inside."
"I was so frightened. I hid myself behind the desk. The students came in and looked for their teacher. I heard them whispering,'Where is she? Where is our new teacher,Ms.Wood?'"
Finally,I stood up from behind the desk. Everyone was surprised. I decided to be honest with my students. I took a deep breath,and told the kids how frightened I was. But I also told them that I wanted to be their best friend and best teacher,too.
"They did not laugh at me. They understood my fear. One body said,'That's okay,Ms.Wood. I get frightened too.' The students were all standing there, smiling at me. They made me feel so comfortable. My fear slowly disappeared."
I can make a joke about it now. But on my first day as a teacher,I was ready to run away. I am very glad that I stayed and overcame my fear.
"I am 'Teacher of the Year' now.But on my first day as a teacher,my fear almost got the best of me."
