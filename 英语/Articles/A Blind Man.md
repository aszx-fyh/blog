Every day when Mike and Sally play outside, they see a man walking. He walks with a white stick. He cannot see.
He is blind. It always puzzles them. "How can he walk on a busy street?" asks Mike. "It must be very dangerous," says Sally.
The boy and girl watch as the man walks. He walks slowly.
He walks to the traffic light and then stops. When the light turns green, he starts walking again. And it must be scary too." says Sally. "He knows where to go and where to stop as if he could see."
One day, as the blind man was passing by, he heard the children talking. He stopped in front of their house. "Hello kids," he said. "I hear you talking about how I walk."
"Yes, we always wonder how you know where to go and where to stop on such a busy street. It is safer to stay indoors."
The man smiled, "I trained myself to listen very well. I listen with my ears for every sound when I am out of the house. I use my stick to help me too. When my stick bumps into something, I know to stop and go around it."
The man continued, "Yes,it is safer indoors. But I love to walk. I love the hot sun. I love the smell of flowers. I love to hear the birds singing. Most of all, I love to get some exercise."
Sally said,"Thank you. We have learned something today. We think you are a brave man. We can see. We can walk. We will get some exercise,too. You are a good example for us follow."
