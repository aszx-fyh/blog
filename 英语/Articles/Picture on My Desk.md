There is a picture sitting on the desk in my room. it's a picture of my parents smiling together in a peach garden. It is special to me because it's the first picture I look for them when I was four years old.
It was holiday weekend. My parents took me to visit a peach orchard in the suburbs. The peach trees were just beginning to bloom. It was a sea of peach flowers-pink and white. So beautiful! There was wonderful sweet smell in the air too. My parents started taking pictures. They took a picture of me,picture of me and my father,picture of me and my mother.
Then Mom asked, "Do you want to take a picture of us too?"
"Yes,yes!" I saied cherrfully. But Dad was worried. He said I was too young and I might drop the camera. He did not want me to break it.
Mom said, "Let him try. He will be careful. He will not drop the camera."  Dad was not sure, but he agreed.
Mom and Dad smiled at the camera. Mom told me look through the little hole where I would see them both in the middle.
"Then hold your breath and click," she said. I listened the camera tightly, I looked through the hole. Yes, I saw them. I saw them in the middle of the window. I pressed the button. Click! The picture was taken!
We got the picture back a few days later. It looked great! Mom and Dad were both in the picture, smiling.
That picture is my favourite. That's why I have it sitting in a special place on my desk. It reminds me of my happy childhood and my first adventure with a camera.
