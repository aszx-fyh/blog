adapted from a traditional African tale
It began to rain in the rich and fertile valley. The rain came pounding down and did't stop for more than fifteen days. The rivers and the lakes were swollen. And all the animals headed to the mountains,seeking safety.
The monkeys were not as worried as the other animals,for they had good brains and could easily make their way uphill to safety if they needed to.
For now,they were perched high in the trees overlooking the flooded lands.
One monkeys noticed fish in the swimming in the water-swimming and leaping and having a great time. Fish,you know,love water and they welcomed the floods with pleasure.In fact,it made them quiet happy,and that was why they leaping out of the water.
The monkeys said to his friends,"Look there. What are those strange creatures doing? Can you see them in the water? They appear to be in danger."
His friends looked too, and they all agreed with him.
"Perhaps we should go and save them," offered one monkey.
"After all,we are the smartest in the jungle."
Everyone agreed. So the monkeys approached the edge of the flood waters and began to catch the fish and bring them safely to land.
The fish were difficult to catch. One monkey even commented that it seemed a shame that these animals without legs did not appreciate what the good monkeys were doing for them.
Soon enough,all the fish were caught and piled on the land. They lay there motionless. "Not a move from them at all," observed a monkey.
"See,we were right to save them," said a wise monkey. "They were tired,and now they are resting. Surely,they will soon wake up and thank us for our efforts."
And with that,the monkeys headed to the hills to see what else they could do.
